# News Site Part V

## High Level Objectives
1. Add tests to your existing news site application
2. Learn the basics of using Puppeteer


## Requirements

1. Add at least 3 unit tests to your news site application. 
  - You may need to refactor your application to make it testable. 
  - Organize your code into small functions that return output based on their input, but cause no side effects.
  - Bonus: Use jest's mocks to test functions that call the API without actually sending HTTP requests.

2. Add at least 3 functional tests to your application.
  - Use puppeteer to drive a browser to test your UI.
  - Verify that a user can navigate the site by clicking links, submiting forms, etc.

**Look ahead:** If you really want another task, start looking into the documentation for [React's Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
